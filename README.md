# Kanban Board

## Description

With how heavily Kanban boards are utilized across the development world, it's vital that users' data is kept secure. JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) help with this process. This project is meant to display my abilities in implementing such security and encode user's auth data. Without this feature, secure servers would not be able to fulfill and verify requests made on the users behalf. Although I didn't build out the direct code for this Kanban layout (starter code was provided) I most definitely implemented the JWTs and their functionality on the backend.

## Installation

Users can clone this code repo using an IDE of choice. They must ensure bcrypt, dotenv, express, jsonwebtoken, pg, sequelize and npm are all installed. Because this code base uses TypeScript, users must utilize 'npx tsc' to build the app and 'npx nodemon' to run dev. Upon doing so, the user should be redirected to a live localhost deployment. This app will also be deployed on Render.

It should be noted that I was given starter code by means of the school. From there, I completed the noted "TODO" sections, and implemented the JWT functionality of this web dev.
